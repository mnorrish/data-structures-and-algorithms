# Data structures and algorithms

_Inspired by [no-stack-dub-sack/cs-playground-react](https://github.com/no-stack-dub-sack/cs-playground-react)_

As a mostly self-taught programmer, I too sometimes feel imposter symdrome in comparison to those who had a more formal education in computer science.

Here is my collection of data structures and algorithms.

All are written in TypeScript as it's my favourite working language but in the future I may add implementations in other languages too.

## To install

`npm i`

## To test

`npm test`
