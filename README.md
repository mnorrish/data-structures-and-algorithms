# Data structures and algorithms

_Inspired by [no-stack-dub-sack/cs-playground-react](no-stack-dub-sack/cs-playground-react)_

I too am a mostly self-taught programmer who sometimes feels imposter symdrome in comparison to those who had more formal education in computer science.

Here is my collection of data structures and algorithms.

Most are written in TypeScript as it's my favourite working language but I may add implemenations in other languages too.
